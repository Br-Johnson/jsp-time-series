abstract: >
  When salmon smolts and fry enter the Ocean as juveniles, they encounter variable marine conditions that influence their survival. How coastal weather proceses interact with climate and oceanic processes impacts nearshore habitat for juvenile salmon migrating in the early phase of their marine migrations. Coastal conditions and events in the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia, Canada, such as spring freshet timing and magnitude, zooplankton phenology, and nearshore ocean temperatures interact with climate driven processes such as the timing of upwelling-favourable winds and oceanic oscillations such as Pacific decadal oscillation. Understanding how these factors interact to drive habitat quality for juvenile salmon is the main objective of The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program, which has been monitoring juvenile salmon migrations in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait (Figure \@ref(fig:map)) since 2015. We found that during the four warmest years recorded in the NE Pacific Ocean to date (2015--2018), juvenile sockeye, pink, and chum left the Strait of Georgia one to two weeks earlier than previously. Timing of the movement of sockeye out of the Strait of Georgia through the Discovery Islands is puncuated with a large pulse of migration in late May which tails off until late June and early July. # REMOVE?: Pink and Chum migrations are more protracted, lasting from early May to late July. Our results indicate that juvenile sockeye move through the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait en masse, likely in response to sea-surface temperature and foraging conditions. This report summarizes migration timing, fish length and weight, parasite loads, species composition, and sea-surface temperature observed from the first four years of this research and monitoring program. We anticipate that combining key migration observations from this research program with observations from freshwater and high-seas sampling will provide, for some stocks, a complete account of the conditions salmon experience during their mirgration from their natal river to the high seas. These measures will further our knowledge of what drives early marine mortality, and better our understanding of how salmon are adapting to climate change.

# Introduction

The first months after marine entry are a critical period for juvenile salmon growth [@Beamish2001], which may ultimately be responsible for inter-annual variability and long-term declines in British Columbian salmon stocks [@Peterman2010; @Beamish2012]. The leading causes of the decline have emerged as the impacts of climate change on marine food web dynamics, followed by uncertainty around pathogens and predators [@Cohen2012V2]. The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program has been monitoring juvenile salmon migrations in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait (Figure \@ref(fig:map)) since 2015 to determine the factors that influence early marine survival of sockeye, pink, and chum [@Hunt2018]. This report summarizes migration timing, fish length, parasite loads, species composition, and sea-surface temperature observed in 2018 and in comparison to what we observed between 2015 and 2017. We also report on the past `r project_years` years of this research and monitoring program in comparison to historical observations. These measures will provide context to investigate questions and interpret results related to growth, survival, and the conditions salmon experience during their early marine migration through this critical region. This work also demonstrates the interannual variability of juvenile sockeye, pink, chum, coho, and herring population characteristics in relation to the anomalous ocean conditions fish experienced in the Strait of Georgia in 2015, 2016, and 2018.

# Methods

## Field methods

  See Hunt et al. (2018) for a detailed description of field and lab methods. Briefly, juvenile salmon were collected weekly from the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait during their northward migration from the Strait of Georgia to Queen Charlotte Strait near northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We sampled from May to July each year, beginning in 2015, using hand-operated purse seine nets (bunt: 27 m x 9 m with 13 mm mesh; tow: 46 m x 9 m with 76 mm mesh) [@LeBrasseur1964; @Godwin2015]. We sampled near-shore marine habitats where depth was > 10 m, effectively sampling sockeye (_Oncorhynchus nerka_), pink (_O. gorbuscha_) and chum (_O. keta_) salmon, and incidentally captured coho (_O. kisutch_), Chinook (_O. tshawytschya_) and Pacific herring (_Clupea pallasii_). All animal care was in accordance with Animal Care Guidelines under permit A16-0101. We collected temperature data by deploying an RBR conductivity, temperature, and depth profiler to depths > 30 m at station QU39 (Figure \@ref(fig:map)) in the northern Strait of Georgia.

## Data Analysis

  Time series anomalies reported are in relation to the time series averages (2015-`r current_year`). Measurements from the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait regions of the salmon migration were combined in analyses unless otherwise indicated. Only sites that were sampled in all years were used. All analyses were conducted using R [@R].

Add clarifying sentence here about why abundance and catch intensity is based on seines that contained sockeye.

  The peak migration date for each species was estimated by calculating the median date of capture in the Discovery Islands. We did this because the period in which surveys and seines were conducted was the same each year and seines were always conducted before sockeye arrived and after sockeye disappeared. Soemtimes, however, the entire duration of the pink and chum migration through the Discovery Islands was not captured because their migration period is more protracted compared to sockeye. Cumulative abundance was calculated over a constrained period between May 1 and July 9 of each year to standardize the period over which cumulative abundance was calculated. Because the Fraser River is an even-year-dominant system for pink salmon, very few out-migrating pink are caught in odd years; consequently, only even years were included in the calculation of the pink migration time series averages.

  In 2015 and 2016 we focussed on capturing sockeye, and only enumerated and sampled other species such as pink and chum when sockeye were caught. As a result, catch statistics such as catch intensity and proportion reflect the fact that we only unumerated and sampled salmon when sockeye were caught. In 2017 and 2018 all seines that captured any species of salmon were enumerated and sampled. These differences in methodology are reflected in the way catch intensity and catch proportions are calculated in so far as catch intensity and catch proportion calculations are restricted to when sockeye were present.
  
  Catch intensity was calculated to provide a measure of inter-annual abundance for sockeye, pink, and chum. Catch intensity was defined as the average number of a species caught when > 1 of that particular species was caught, and when sockeye were also caught. In effect, catch intensity summarizes the abundance of each species in a community of co-migrating sockeye, pink, and chum.
  
  Species proportions were calculated by dividing the total number of each species caught by the sum of all species caught that season. Only seines that caught sockeye were used in the calculation of species for the same reason stated previously. To test whether fork lengths from `r current_year` were significantly different than the time series averages, an independent two-group t-test was conducted. Fork length distributions were visualized by calculating length frequency distributions using kernel density estimates from fork length data.
  
  The abundance of _Caligus clemensi_ and _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ sea lice was determined by calculating the mean number of lice on all fish observed, according to the definition in @Margolis1990. Only motile (i.e., pre-adult and adult) stages were included in analyses while nauplius, copepodid, and chalimus life stages were excluded. Mean abundance estimates and 95% confidence intervals were bootrapped 1000 times from the counts of lice obtained for each species of louse, respecting the hierarchical nature of observations on sockeye, pink and chum from the same seine, in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait, from each of the past `r project_years`.
  
  The mean sea-surface temperature (SST) was calculated from the top 30 m of the water column in May and June--the period during which salmon migrate through the region. To visualize temperature anomalies, a LOESS regression was applied to sea-surface temperatures from all years to represent the average seasonal trend. 

# Results
  Migration timing was similar in 2018 compared to the previous four years for sockeye pink and chum, which are among the earliest migration timings recorded. Catch intensity was high for Pink and Chum, but low for sockeye. Pink and Chum were longer than normal ('normal' refers to the study period `r study_range`), but sockeye were shorter than normal. There appears to be a pattern of pink and chum length anomalies varying together and sometimes opposite of sockeye. (Figure \@ref(fig:heatmap)). Sea lice abundance was low in 2018. Sea-surface temperatures in 2018 during the smolt migration period in the northern Strait of Georgia were the warmest recorded between 2015 and 2018.

Migration timing in the Discovery Islands in 2018 did not differ from the time series average by more than 5--7 days—the expected accuracy of the calculations—for sockeye, pink, or chum (Figure \@ref(fig:migration-timing-plot)) (Table \@ref(tab:migration-timing-table)). The peak migration date for sockeye in the Discovery Islands was on `r f(so_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(so_timing_diff)` days `r so_later_or_earlier` than the time series average of `r f(so_q2_DI_TSA)`. The peak migration date for pink in the Discovery Islands was on `r f(pi_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(pi_timing_diff)` days `r pi_later_or_earlier` than the average of `r f(pi_q2_DI_TSA)`. The peak migration date for chum in the Discovery Islands was on `r f(cu_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(cu_timing_diff)` days `r cu_later_or_earlier` than the average of `r f(cu_q2_DI_TSA)`.

Sockeye catch intensity in 2018 was low relative to sockeye in previous years and relative to pink and chum in 2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:catch-intensity-plot)). That sockeye catch intensity was low in 2018 is not surprising because 2016 brood year Shuswap or Chilko Lake sockeye, two stocks which are among the most productive, are not as abundant in this cohort as they are in others. Pink catch intensity in 2018 was the highest of the four years measured. Pink out-migrants are more abundant on even years, the result of the odd-year dominant life-cycle of Fraser River pinks [@Heard1991], but 2018 catches indicate either good production or good survival in the early marine environment for pink salmon relative to 2016—the only other odd-year dominant brood year recorded by the Juvenile Salmon Program.

Pink salmon dominated the catch in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone in 2018 making up `r pi_prop` % of the catch (Table \@ref(tab:proportion-table)) while chum made up `r cu_prop` % and sockeye `r so_prop` % (Figure \@ref(fig:proportion-plot)). 2018 was the first time in the time series that pink dominated the catch proportion.

Fish lengths varied between regions, and among species and years (Figure \@ref(fig:length-plot)) though in `r current_year` sockeye were `r ifelse(len_tt[1,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")`, pink were `r ifelse(len_tt[2,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")`, and chum were `r ifelse(len_tt[3,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than their respective time series averages in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait combined. Sockeye length was `r round(len_tt[1,3],1)` mm (Table \@ref(tab:length-table)), which is `r abs(round(len_tt[1,2],1))` mm `r ifelse(len_tt[1,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than the time series average (_p_ < 0.0001, 95% CI `r abs(round(len_tt[1,8],1))` -`r abs(round(len_tt[1,9],1))`). Average pink lengths were `r round(len_tt[2,3],1)` mm, which is `r abs(round(len_tt[2,2],1))` mm `r ifelse(len_tt[2,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than the time series average (_p_ < 0.0001, 95% CI `r abs(round(len_tt[2,8],1))`-`r abs(round(len_tt[2,9],1))`). Chum  were on average `r round(len_tt[3,3],1)` mm, which is `r abs(round(len_tt[3,2],1))` mm  `r ifelse(len_tt[3,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than the time series average (_p_ < 0.0001, 95% CI `r abs(round(len_tt[3,8],1))`-`r round(len_tt[3,9],1)`). Interestingly, sockeye length was, again, the opposite anomaly compared to pink and chum which tend to vary together (Figure @ref(fig:heatmap). The length frequencies observed here represent the range of fish sizes caught in the nearshore area at the specified times. There is currently no quantitative data available with which to weight these estimates relative to the proportion of fish that migrate in nearshore habitats from which to produce population estimates.

The abundance of motile sea lice in 2018 was the among the lowest recorded in the Discovery Islands time-series while Johnstone Strait parasite loads were average. (Figure \@ref(fig:sealice-abundance-plot)). Notably, no _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ were detected on sockeye in Johnstone Strait, despite being present in the Discovery Islands. The time series averages indicate pink salmon have higher sea lice abundance, prevalence, and intensity compared to chum, and sockeye (Table \@ref(tab:sealice-table)) in contrast to @Patanasatienkul2013 where they found that the prevalence and intensity of sea lice was higher on chum than pink on early marine entrants in the Broughton Archipelago.

Sea-surface temperature in May and June during the juvenile salmon out-migration at QU39 in the northern Strait of Georgia was `r round(sst_stats_table$estimate, 2)` degrees C warmer than average (Table \@ref(tab:sst-table)) (Figure \@ref(fig:sst-plot)). In the context of the last four last years, 2018 was the warmest surface waters observed in the northern Strait of Georgia, despite 2015 SST along the BC coast breaking records for high temperatures [@Chandler2017]. 

# Discussion

Sockeye migration timing through the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait is highly left-skewed [@BrettJohnson2018]. The number of days between the 25th and 50th percentile of catch abundance was two days on average, indicating that there is a punctuated event that triggers their northerly migration (Table \@ref(tab:migration-timing-table)). In 2014, a DFO purse seiner measured that 80% of sockeye passed through the Discovery Islands between June 12 and June 19th [@Neville2016]. We observed 80 % of sockeye migrate through the Discovery Islands by June 1 in 2015 and 2018 and by June 5 in 2016, which is roughly two and a half weeks earlier than observed in 2014. Sockeye from 2014 and 2017 are from the same cyclic dominance cohort, and the year 2017 exhibited the latest migration timing of all four run cycles observed, suggesting that this run cycle tends to migrate later than the others, or some other factor that both 2014 and 2017 had in common affected their migration timing. Sockeye leave the Strait of Georgia 12-20 days before pink and chum, which is driven mostly by water temperatures [@LeBrasseur1964], in addition to better foraging conditions on the continental shelf where upwelling nutrients contribute to higher productivity (Ref). However, sea-surface temperatures in the northern Strait of Georgia in 2017 were the coolest between 2015--2017, confounding the interpretation of the late 2014/2017 run cycle if we assume that sea-surface temperature is what predominantly drives juvenile salmon to migrate north of the Strait of Georgia. 

In 2017 Chum migrations were also later than average, and as a result, we did not completely capture the tail end of the migration. In 1983, two trawl surveys were conducted in Discovery Passage and the surrounding channels and found that pink and chum abundance peaked in late June [@Levings1983]. We observed peak pink and chum migration timing to be June 14th, up to a week earlier than observed in 1983. However, the direct comparison of these estimates, and the interpreation the statistics in this report, are subject to some unknown degree of bias as a result of gear selectivity, and non-random distributions of fish lengths in the habitats sampled. This highlights the need for quanitification of the fine-scale distribution and habitat use of coastal channels by migrating juvenile salmon, along a gradient of depth and distance from shore.

We have now captured the entire four-year life cycle of Fraser River sockeye salmon, two years of odd-year dominant pink juveniles, and four years of chum migrations. However, we have only observed the early marine conditions experienced by a genetically distinct community of co-migrating salmon, four separate times. Each annual observation is a unique cohort of sockeye genetic stocks, and pink, chum, coho, and herring proportions. Replicated observations of sockeye genetic cycle lines will be possible beginning May 2019, when we observe the same cycle line we observed in 2015. 

In 2017 there was a coherent decline in adult sockeye salmon stocks in 2017 up and down the coast of British Columbia as a result of warm ocean conditions in the NE Pacific in 2015 and 2016 [@Chandler2018]. Record sea-surface temperatures in 2015, 2016, and 2018 likely drove juvenile salmon out of the Strait of Georgia one to two weeks earlier than historically.  Three of the last four years; 2015, 2016, and 2018 have been the warmest temperatures ever recorded (Chandler & Boldt, 2016) CHECK. Ultimately, because the last four years held anomalous atmospheric and ocean conditions, we observed juvenile salmon be impacted by and respond to climate change. As adult salmon return from the high-seas, having experienced these anomalous conditions, we will gain a better understanding of what the overall impact to salmon productivity will be. As we continue to dis-entangle the web of local and global weather and climate interactions, we will to identify the most important factors influencing early marine survival of Pacific salmon.

# Tables

```{r z-scores-table}
heatmap_data <- heatmap_data %>% 
  select(spp, year, measure, Estimate, SD, Z)
knitr::kable(heatmap_data, col.names = c("Species", "Year","Parameter", "Estimate", "SD", "Z score"), format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:z-scores-table) Key salmon health, growth, and migration annual estimates. Migration timing estimates are the median capture date in the Discovery Islands, catch intensity estimates are the mean catch when greater than one sockeye are caught in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait combined, length estimates are the mean fork length (mm) in both regions combined, parasite loads are mean abundance for motile lice from both regions combined, and SST is the mean sea-surface temperature in degrees celcius at station QU39 in the northern Strait of Georgia. Standard deviation is denoted by SD and is the within-year standard deviation (note no SD for median capture dates). Z score is the number of standard deviations the annual estimate is away from the time series mean.


```{r migration-timing-table}
migration_timing$Species <- factor(migration_timing$Species) %>% 
  fct_relevel("SO", "PI", "CU") %>% 
  fct_recode("Sockeye" = "SO", "Pink" = "PI", "Chum" = "CU")

migration_timing <- migration_timing %>% 
  drop_na()
knitr::kable(migration_timing, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:migration-timing-table) Migration timing statistics for the cumulative catch of sockeye, pink, and chum salmon in the Discovery Islands in 2018, compared to the time-series average (2015 - `r current_year`). Q1 is when 25 % of the species passed through the regions, peak date is the median when 50 % passed through, Q3 is 75%, and Spread is the difference between Peak Date and Q1. The region DI indicates the Discovery Islands while for species SO is sockeye, PI is pink, and CU is chum. 

```{r catch-intensity-table}
catch_intensity <- catch_intensity %>% 
  select("year", "species", "mean_catch")

knitr::kable(catch_intensity, format = 'markdown', 
             col.names = c("Year", "Species", "Catch Intensity"))
```
Table: (\#tab:catch-intensity-table) Catch intensity—our proxy for abundance—for sockeye, pink, and chum in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait combined.


```{r length-table}
summary_lengths$species <- factor(summary_lengths$species) %>% 
  fct_relevel("SO", "PI", "CU") %>% 
  fct_recode("Sockeye" = "SO", "Pink" = "PI", "Chum" = "CU")
summary_lengths <- summary_lengths %>% 
  select(Year = year, Region = region, Species = species, N = n, "Fork Length" = fork_length, CI = CI)
knitr::kable(summary_lengths, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:length-table) Mean fork lengths for each year, species, and region with the 95 % confidence interval (95% CI). The column n indicates the number of fish measured.


```{r proportion-table}
knitr::kable(proportions_table, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:proportion-table) The species proportions of total catch in each year for sockeye, pink, chum, herring, coho, and Chinook.

```
Table: (\#tab:sealice-table) Mean sea-louse abundance, prevalence, and intensity (as defined in Margolis et al. 1990) across the time series (2015-`r current_year`) for each fish, region, and year. 95% confidence intervals were calculated from annual averages. The region DI indicates the Discovery Islands and JS Johnstone Strait.
