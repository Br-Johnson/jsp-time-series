@article{Beamish2012,
abstract = {Trawl studies from 1998 to 2009 indicated that juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and Pacific herring Clupea pallasii represented 98{\%} of the fish in the surface waters of the Strait of Georgia during the day in the spring and early summer. Standardized catches of all juvenile Pacific salmon in the trawl surveys were lowest in 2007. Catches of young-of-the-year Pacific herring were also extremely low in 2007. Three years later, the 2007 year-class had the lowest recruitment to the fishery in recorded history. In 2007, juvenile coho salmon O. kisutch and Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were small and had the lowest condition of the fish in all surveys as well as a high percentage of empty stomachs. The early marine survival of coho salmon in 2007 and the total survival in 2008 were exceptionally poor. Trawl catches of juvenile chum salmon O. keta in 2007 were the lowest of all surveys. Adult chum salmon from these juveniles that returned in 2010 had extremely poor survival. Juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka that entered the Strait of Georgia in the spring of 2007 and returned to the Fraser River as adults in 2009 also had such exceptionally poor marine survival that a judicial inquiry was conducted to determine the causes. The synchronous poor growth, survival, or both of all of themajor species in the surface waters of the Strait ofGeorgia in the spring of 2007 indicated that there was a common cause which we propose as poor food production. The causes of the high mortality likely represented a unique extreme in the variability of the factors that normally affect the survival of juvenile Pacific salmon and Pacific herring in the early marine period in the Strait of Georgia.},

abstract = {Juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta were sampled by beach or purse seine to assess levels of sea lice infestation in the Knight Inlet and Broughton Archipelago regions of coastal British Columbia, Canada, during the months of March to July from 2003 to 2012. Beach seine data were analyzed for sea lice infestation that was described in terms of prevalence, abundance, intensity, and intensity per unit length. The median annual prevalence for chum was 30{\%}, ranging from 14{\%} (in 2008 and 2009) to 73{\%} (in 2004), while for pink salmon, the median was 27{\%} and ranged from 10{\%} (in 2011) to 68{\%} (in 2004). Annual abundance varied from 0.2 to 5 sea lice per fish with a median of 0.47 for chum and from 0.1 to 3 lice (median 0.42) for pink salmon. Annual infestation followed broadly similar trends for both chum and pink salmon. However, the abundance and intensity of Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi, the 2 main sea lice species of interest, were significantly greater on chum than on pink salmon in around half of the years studied. Logistic regression with random effect was used to model prevalence of sea lice infestation for the combined beach and purse seine data. The model suggested inter-annual variation as well as a spatial clustering effect on the prevalence of sea lice infestation in both chum and pink salmon. Fish length had an effect on prevalence, although the nature of this effect differed according to host species.},

@article{Neville2016,
abstract = {Many stocks of Pacifi c salmon enter into and transit through the Strait of Georgia during their migration to off shore waters. Knowledge of the duration of juvenile sockeye salmon residency in the Strait of Georgia and when they migrate out of the strait is essential to understand both natural and anthropogenic factors that may be regulating their early marine survival. We present results from the fi rst year of a multi-year integrated study that demonstrates stock-specifi c diff erences in the migration timing of juvenile Fraser River sockeye salmon over the fi rst eight to 12 weeks of their marine life. The geography of the study region provides a unique opportunity to sample virtually the entire population as they migrate down the Fraser River and as they leave the Strait of Georgia through the Discovery Islands and lower Johnstone Strait. This analysis indicated that juvenile 1-year-old sockeye salmon were resident in the Strait of Georgia for seven to eight weeks in 2014. The catch rates in the Discovery Islands indicated that, in 2014, the peak migration period for Fraser River sockeye salmon occurred over approximately two weeks, with about 80{\%} of all sockeye salmon caught between June 12 and June 19. The results suggest that the Strait of Georgia and the Discovery Islands/Johnstone Strait regions function in a similar manner as the nursery lakes and main river ways in the Fraser River watershed. The Strait of Georgia provides abundant food in a relatively protected habitat similar to their rearing lakes in the watershed. The Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait, an area of lower food availability, is similar to the river, where fi sh move in concentrated numbers through high current fl ow areas over a relatively short period of time.},

abstract = {Chum, pink, coho, chinook, steelhead, and sockeye juvenile were sampled with a two boat trawl in channels leading off the northern Strait of Georgia. Chum dominated the catches and peaked in abundance in late June, as did pinks. It is probable that the majority of the chum were from the Fraser system. Chinook and coho were less abundant and were primarily fish from Quinsam hatchery. Steelhead and sockeye were uncommon. Length frequency data are given for fish subsampled from the trawls. Judging from data obtained in June 1983, most of the chum migrating to sea from the northern Strait of Georgia use Discovery Passage. If stock composition were determined, Discovery Passage could be a useful monitoring location for migrating juvenile salmonids.},

These subprogrammes are discussed in terms of the content and operational level of the technologies selected and the stratum and age of the population included. The use of resources is examined in relation to the optimality of the programme. Shadow prices are introduced to provide guidance for modifying constraints in order to render the programme more effective. The feasibility of modifying the ceilings of resources and of introducing new constraints, and the significance of such variations, are discussed. Methodological problems are identified and discussed.},
